# Repository Overview
This repository contains some of the analysis materials for the *"The Hands-Up Problem and How to Deal With It: Secondary School Teachers' Experiences of Debugging in the Classroom"* paper.

The study was qualitative and we do not have ethical approval to publish participating teachers' interview transcripts. Therefore, this repository contains the following files:
- `interview_schedule.pdf` - The interview questions teachers were asked.
- `agreement_procedure.pdf` - Details on the negotiated agreement procedure used by the authors.
- `codebook_definitions/` - Directory containing three versions of the codebook used to code the teacher interviews, with `codebook_definitions_v3.pdf` being the final version.
